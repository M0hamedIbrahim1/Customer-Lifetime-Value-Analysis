# EDA - Customer Lifetime Value

In the world of business analytics, understanding and calculating Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) is essential. There are various approaches to calculate CLTV, and each business may have its own perspective on what's suitable. In this section, we will explore one approach.

## CLTV Formula

The CLTV formula we will explore is as follows:

CLTV = ((Average Order Value x Purchase Frequency) / Churn Rate) x Profit Margin.

### 1. Calculate Average Order Value
- Explanation of how to calculate Average Order Value goes here.

### 2. Calculate Purchase Frequency
- Explanation of how to calculate Purchase Frequency goes here.

### 3. Calculate Repeat Rate and Churn Rate
- Description of how to calculate Repeat Rate and Churn Rate.
- The percentage of Repeat Rate is: 98.34%.


### 4. Calculate Profit Margin
- Profit Margin represents the percentage of total sales earned as profit. Assuming a 10% profit margin for our business.

### 5. Calculate Customer Lifetime Value
- The final step is to calculate the Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) based on the formula above.

This is just one approach to CLTV analysis. Your business may have its own unique considerations and metrics to calculate CLTV effectively.
## Customer Segmentation

Segmenting your customers based on their total purchase value is a powerful way to understand your customer base and tailor your marketing and business strategies effectively.

## Customers With High Transactions

Identifying and analyzing customers with high transaction volumes is essential for optimizing your sales strategies and ensuring the highest customer satisfaction.

## Geographic Analysis

Geographic analysis provides valuable insights into customer distribution, regional preferences, and the impact of location on business operations.

### TOP 10 Countries in Revenue of Purchase

Identifying the top countries contributing to revenue can help prioritize marketing efforts and expansion strategies.

### In Which Country Do We Have More Customers?

Understanding the distribution of customers across different countries is essential for tailoring marketing campaigns and optimizing customer experiences.

### Countries That Have High Cancellation of Orders

Identifying countries with a high rate of order cancellations can inform strategies for reducing cancellations and improving customer satisfaction.

### Countries with Low Cancellation of Orders
Highlighting countries with low order cancellation rates can serve as examples of effective business operations and customer satisfaction.
## Time Series Analysis

Time series analysis involves examining data collected or recorded over time to identify patterns, trends, and insights. This section focuses on understanding temporal aspects of your business data.

### Any Patterns or Trends in Count of Orders?

Analyzing the count of orders over time can reveal trends and patterns that are essential for business planning and decision-making.

### Month VS Total Purchase

Exploring the relationship between months and total purchase can provide insights into monthly variations in sales and revenue.

### Month with High Cancellation of Orders
